ElasticSearch try and error on windows:

Before start running “bin\elasticsearch.bat’
1.Add one line to config\elasticsearch.yml to avoid error:
ingest.geoip.downloader.enabled: false
2. change config\elasticsearch.yml
xpack.security.enabled: false  #http works, no need https (login)
3. change config\elasticsearch.yml
discovery.seed_hosts: ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]

ES is a distributed system
ES can be directly decompressed without configuration. One ES is decompressed on hadoop1, 
and one ES is decompressed on hadoop2, and then the two ESs are started. They form a cluster.
There is a preset configuration in ES. The default value of clustername is ElasticSearch. 
If the value is the same, it belongs to the same cluster, and different values are different clusters.

Use Management->Fleet to set up Elastic Agent:
1. config/elasticsearch.yml file configuration:
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true (add this line)
2. bin\elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token.bat --scope kibana
3. Then there will be an extra 'enterprise search' item on the home page
